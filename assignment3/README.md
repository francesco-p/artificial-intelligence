# Assignment 3 : Dimensionality Reduction and Classification

Perform perform **Principal Component Analysis** of the Semeion Handwritten Digit data set and show a scatter plot of the first 2 principal components of all the images in the database.

Study the performance of a **Nearest Neighbor classifier** as you increase the number of the principal components from 0 (means only) to the full set of 256 components. Take 10 randomly selected images per class as learning samples for k-nn. Repeat the selection and classification several times.

Test also the performance of the Nearest Neighbor classifier using all the dimensions available, but computing the distances on the whitened data and the independet components. For ICA you can use the implemetnation here.


### Folder `html`
- Published code with matlab, other parts of the report.

	Instead of running the code (task2 takes 10 mins, unless you load the .mat file and run the plot section) 
	you can give a look each task html, it's published directly within matlab

### Folder `code`
- The code. 
	To run the code : include to the matlab workspace --> everything inside the code folder.
