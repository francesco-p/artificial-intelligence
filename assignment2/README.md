# Assignment 2 : Decision Tree Learning

Learn a **decision tree** for the [Heart Disease data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) of the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)

Write a program that learns a tree with maximum depth d and choose the depth using cross-validation on the training set.
Evaluate the performance of the learned tree on a test set of at least 100 samples.
Data used for learning (even cross validation) should neve be used for testing!
Deliver the learning code as well as a report of the cross validation and training results and the lessons learned.

### Folder  `learningtrees`:
  - Contains the C# code of an improved version of the ID3 algorithm (it resembles C4.5)
