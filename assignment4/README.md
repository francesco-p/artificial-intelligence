# Assignment 4 : Manifold Learning 

> I deleted the original problem statement, this is a brief description

Compare PCA with k-Isomap and k-Laplacian Eigenmap using the hand posture [Triesch Dataset](http://www.idiap.ch/resource/gestures/)


### Folder `code`
- IsomapStanford : matlab files to compute isomap
- LaplacianBeikin: matlab files to compute laplacian eigenmaps
- `Triesch_Dataset`: the dataset 
- several files `<name>.m`: these are usiliary files 
- `pcaTask.m` `klemTask.m` `kisomapTask.m` : these are the main tasks to run in matlab. Before run them, we must import the three folders into Matlab.
